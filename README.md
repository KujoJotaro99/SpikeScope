**SpikeScope** is a flexible and extensible toolkit designed for profiling **spiking neural networks** (SNNs). It provides analysis of:

- Neuron spiking statistics (firing rates, distributions)
- Static and dynamic memory movement
- Estimated energy usage during inference
- Layer-wise breakdowns and visualization tools

Built on PyTorch and snnTorch, SpikeScope is aimed at researchers, engineers, and students seeking to understand the **efficiency and behavior** of their SNN models — from toy networks to deep architectures on neuromorphic hardware.

## Key Features

- Spike counting and firing rate estimation
- Layer-wise memory and traffic profiling
- Exportable reports (JSON, plots)
